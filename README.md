# Nail Size Automation Tool

A Python program that automates assigning press-on nail sizes for customers. Users input nail measurements in inches for each finger, and the program automatically converts them to standardized size numbers (0–9) and saves the data to a CSV file. This tool streamlines nail size management, reduces manual lookup errors, and helps small businesses efficiently track and manage customer nail preferences.

## Features
- Input nail measurements in inches for each finger (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky)
- Automatically convert measurements to standardized size numbers (0–9)
- Save customer names and sizes to a CSV file (`customers.csv`)
- View all saved customers and their nail sizes
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
